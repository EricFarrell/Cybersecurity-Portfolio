## Maltego: Social Engineering Awareness: Ethical Email Discovery and Phishing Simulation
### Objective
- Use open-source intelligence tools to identify a potential phishing target
- Demonstrate how phishing attacks are created
- Highlighting the importance of cybersecurity awareness


 
## Steps taken
### Reconnaissance and OSINT:
Used Maltego to collect publicly available information about Coca-Cola's leadership team.
Discovered an email address associated with a C-suite executive using ethical, legal methods.

### Phishing Email Creation:
I crafted a simulated fictional phishing email to demonstrate how attackers might exploit this information. From the target's Linkedin, I noticed he is on the board of directors for Vanguard. I tailored the simulated phishing email as if it came from an executive from the board of communications at Vanguard.
Included common phishing tactics (e.g., spoofed sender addresses, urgent language, malicious links).

### Awareness and Prevention:
Phishing and social engineering attacks are significant cybersecurity threats. Mitigation strategies include implementing multi-factor authentication, educating users on recognizing suspicious communications, enabling email filtering tools, conducting regular security awareness training, and establishing incident response protocols. By adopting these practices, organizations can effectively reduce the risk of compromise and enhance their overall security posture.
