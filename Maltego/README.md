### Social Engineering Awareness: Ethical Email Discovery and Phishing Simulation Using Maltego
 The objective is to use open-source intelligence tools to identify a potential phishing target and demonstrate how phishing attacks are created, highlighting the importance of cybersecurity awareness.
 
## Steps taken:
### Reconnaissance and OSINT:
Used Maltego to collect publicly available information about Coca-Cola's leadership team.
Discovered an email address associated with a C-suite executive using ethical, legal methods.

### Phishing Email Creation:
Crafted a simulated fictional phishing email to demonstrate how attackers might exploit this information. From the target's Linkedin, I noticed he is on the board of directors for Vanguard. I tailored the simulated phishing email as if it came from an executive from the board of communications at Vanguard.
Included common phishing tactics (e.g., spoofed sender addresses, urgent language, malicious links).

### Awareness and Prevention:
Highlighted the vulnerabilities exposed by OSINT and social engineering techniques.
Proposed mitigation strategies, such as limiting public information, email filtering, and employee training.
