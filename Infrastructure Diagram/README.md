## Infrastructure Diagram with Intellectual Tools

### Objective
- Design a network infrastructure consisting of five departments, each with 25 users. 
- Each department will be equipped with its own dedicated switch, with one department isolated on an air-gapped network using a separate, isolated switch. 
- The network will feature both an internal and an external firewall, a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system, DHCP, ISP connectivity, routers, an Intrusion Detection System (IDS), a proxy server, an email server, a Demilitarized Zone (DMZ), and an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS). 
- Wireshark will be utilized for network traffic analysis and monitoring.
