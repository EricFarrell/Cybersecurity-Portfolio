 ## Active Directory
 ### Objectives
- Update the system.
- Create a root domain.
- Create an Organizational Unit (OU) and add 10 users to it.
- Create 5 groups within the OU.
- Assign users to appropriate groups.
- Implement password policies for each of the 5 groups.
- Restrict login hours for each department to 9 AM â€“ 8 PM, Monday to Friday.
- Grant the Human Resources department read, write, and modify all properties of Active Directory user information.
- Allow the IT department to reset passwords and enforce password changes on the next login for all user accounts.

 
 Before making any changes, I went to the settings and ensured the system is up to date on the latest update.

 Within Windows Server 2019, I created a root domain using my last name.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e9d432f4-d663-469f-b62f-370ec9adf9f9)

I then created an organizational unit (OU) named CYB-515.

Within the Administrator Command Prompt, I created 10 user accounts to put into the OU that was just created by using the following commands:

**dsadd user "cn=John Doe4,OU=CYB-515,dc=farrell,dc=com" -samid Doe4J -upn Doe4J@farrell.com -fn John -ln "Doe 4" -display "John Doe4" -disabled no -pwd "Password1" -mustchpwd no**

Within Administrator Windows PowerShell, I also created five groups that were placed into the OU.

Password policies within Active Directory for each of the five groups were implemented. Along with a "gpupdate /force" to update Group Policy Settings immediately.

In the following three screenshots, I placed three users into the Human Resources Department group, three other users in the Research and Developement group, and four other users in the IT Department group.

For the Research and Developement Department group, I limited this departments logon hours from 9AM to 8PM Monday through Friday.
In the following two screenshots, I enabled to "disconnect clients when logon hours expire". 
Along with The gpupdate /force command in Windows Server 2019 refreshes and reapplies all Group Policy settings immediately, ensuring both user and computer policies are updated regardless of changes.

I gave control to the Human Resources Department to Read, Write, and Write all Properties of all active directory user account information.

I gave access the IT Department group the ability to reset passwords and force a password change at the next log-on for all active directory user accounts.

For the following user "John Doe 4" since they are apart of the Human Resources Department, it shows that they are able to edit a user account in Active Directory.

For the users apart of the IT department, they can not edit user accounts in Active Directory, but they are able to change passwords of all other users.

### Next Objective
- Join Windows 11 VM to the domain.
- Disable automatic administrative logon.

In windows 11, I navigated to the settings/system/about and selected Domain. I was then able to change the domain of the system by simply entering my domain name of "whatever.com". If I wanted to put this system into a work group, I would be able to do so from the same properties page.

In Windows Server 2019, I navigated to Local Security Policy/Local Policies/Security Options and "Disabled" "Recovery console: Allow automatic adminsitrative logon". Once applied, I was prompted to enter the password of
the account that's to be configured.

I then restarted the Windows Server 2019 VM and was presented with a bitLocker drive encryption screen prompting me to enter the password to unlock the drive.
